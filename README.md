# About My Site

For my site, I wanted to go with a minimalist, VICELAND-esque aesthetic with basic colors like black and white, with heavy contrast making it easy for all devices to display aswell as making it easy to read, I also wanted to make sure that it would be in my skill range for coding but challenging enough so that I don't breeze through it. Some of the challenges that I ran into was with the responsive nature of the site, the flow, and how I want to express myself. The responsive was difficult due to the two images displayed in the about me page and how I wanted them to display, I was struggling to create a site that flows well on every responsive view, I also made the header black on the mobile because I thought it would work better for mobile. The flow of the site was difficult because I wasnâ€™t quite sure on how I want others to go through my site I went through various versions even trying a multiple page view but ended up with the single view as the best. I also wanted the site to take show off my skills and my coding abilities so I tried to my best to code most of it but I did use a bootstrap library for the image gallery.
